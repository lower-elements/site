# Taking Over the Mud People with FOSS!

Hello there! We're a group of blind friends passionate about, among other things: technology, [free, open source
software][foss], and the [Artemis Fowl series of books][af].

## Artemis What?

[Artemis Fowl][af] is a fantastic series of children's and young adult's books, written by Irish author [Eoin
Colfer][ec].

[ec]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eoin_Colfer>

Did you know that miles beneath our feet lives a fairy civilisation far more advanced than humans, that has remained hidden for
years thanks not to magic, but to superior technology? Well, and a bit of magic, too. And did you know that the first
human to make contact with "the people" and come out on top was twelve years old when he did so?

That civilisation is our namesake (the Lower Elements), and that human is Artemis Fowl.

Okay, I'll stop writing an alternative blurb for the series now, the real blurb's much better! ðŸ˜›

> Twelve-year-old villain Artemis Fowl is the most ingenious criminal mastermind in history. His bold and daring plan is
> to hold a leprechaun to ransom.
>
> But he's taking on more than he bargained for when he kidnaps Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon (Lower Elements
> Police Reconnaissance Unit). For a start, leprechaun technology is more advanced than our own. Add to that the fact
> that Holly is a true heroine and that her senior officer Commander Root will stop at nothing to get her back and
> you've got the mother of all sieges brewing!

## Free what?

We're huge proponents of [free, libre][fs], [open source][os] software. Developing the software that runs our lives out
in the open increases security, encourages innovation, prevents monopolistic practices and above all, makes technology
accessible to everyone.

We're also believers in [a decentralised, federated][fed] [self-hosted][selfhosted]  web and projects like
[ActivityPub][ap], [Mastodon][mastodon], [Matrix][matrix], [Bit Torrent][bt], [NextCloud][nc], etc.
