# Final Hour, A zomby Audio FPS inspired by Call of Duty Zombies

## What is Final Hour

Final Hour is a complex, innovative audiogame that attempts to bring the experience of sighted and blind gamers closer
together. Inspired by the Call of Duty Zombies franchise, we hope that the mainstream concepts will transport the blind
gaming experience further from the limitting and unwieldy gameplay of current audiogames and closer to mainstream's
practicality.
